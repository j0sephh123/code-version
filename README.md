# Summary
Have small code snippets or several files shown here with different versioning.  
This has been something extremely hard for me to get around.  
Still I'm not sure how it would be implemented, but it should, because I need something like that to organize my head around certain concepts.

## Used libs:  
- __nx__ as monorepo
- __Vite__ as a React bundler
- __wouter__ for client side routing
- __daisyUI__ for styling
